    Dynamically load a user interface from the given ``uifile``.

    ``uifile`` is a string containing a file name of the UI file to load.

    If ``baseinstance`` is ``None``, the a new instance of the top-level widget
    will be created.  Otherwise, the user interface is created within the given
    ``baseinstance``.  In this case ``baseinstance`` must be an instance of the
    top-level widget class in the UI file to load, or a subclass thereof.  In
    other words, if you've created a ``QMainWindow`` interface in the designer,
    ``baseinstance`` must be a ``QMainWindow`` or a subclass thereof, too.  You
    cannot load a ``QMainWindow`` UI file with a plain
    :class:`~PySide.QtGui.QWidget` as ``baseinstance``.

    ``customWidgets`` is a dictionary mapping from class name to class object
    for widgets that you've promoted in the Qt Designer interface. Usually,
    this should be done by calling registerCustomWidget on the QUiLoader, but
    with PySide 1.1.2 on Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64 this causes a segfault.

    :method:`~PySide.QtCore.QMetaObject.connectSlotsByName()` is called on the
    created user interface, so you can implemented your slots according to its
    conventions in your widget class.

    Return ``baseinstance``, if ``baseinstance`` is not ``None``.  Otherwise
    return the newly created instance of the user interface.
